              ego due to the core learning?</b

          </h2>

          <p>
            I found out that writing essays is a lovely way to let your brain
            breath after you’ve been (eye)balls deep in code for a few days.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we’re talking about the ego that takes a beating when you lose a
            battle or your self worth is challenged, I think that ego did OK
            because I never had a chance to compare my progress to anybody
            else's. Initially I was finding it really hard to have any sense of
            progress without having peers or feedback as a reference point, but
            slowly I grew to to really like it. I learnt to take satisfaction
            from my own personal and learned to appreciate feeling like the work
            I was doing was self motivated and not motivated by competitiveness.
            No tall poppies, no comparison thieving joy. Just good hard work. So
            I guess I learnt constant feedback isn’t so important while you’re
            learning. Everybody messes up the first few pancakes and that’s fine
            so long as you’re making progress and upskilling.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learnt that I can really focus on task if I need to and all I
            really need to do is build a strong base programme and then the
            dopamine kicks in and I can go for hours. As soon as I start having
            fun with a project, and feeling like I can make it do whatever I
            want, the deep focus kicks in and it’s great.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also learned studying learning is a really awesome motivating way
            to get better at learning - I'm a sucker for a cool weird new memory
            technique or a kooky learning twist that makes everything better, so
            learning how to learn about learning was a really big bonus for me.

            Values shape how you act and control yourself in professional
            settings and work environments particularly when you practise
            mindfulness (the act of triaging emotion on the way in and delving
            into the root of why you’re feeling them and how you should refactor
            them before you express them outwardly) Your values will be key in
            assessing why you do this, and will help you hown this skill and use
            it for the greatest possible good if you are willing to practise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do you value stability and diligence in yourself? Mindfulness will
            help you listen to these values and control frustration during
            problem solving struggles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do you value achievement and perseverance? Mindfulness will help
            cull defeatest self-talk and negative ideation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Empathy impacts how you interact with the people you share your
            learning environment with- it changes how you process other peoples
            actions and allows your reaction to them to be geared towards the
            best possible outcome, having mutual respect and a moral sense of
            human understanding. Its the acknowledgement that we are all complex
            imperfect beings, we all have our perspective shaped by unique
            circumstances and we all have the right to be heard and treated with
            respect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Self awareness makes both these value based behaviour filters much
            easier to manage and regulate. Without being aware of your flaws and
            thought processing sequences it would be really hard to change them
            for the better.

          <h2>
            <b>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b>
          </h2>
          <p>
            I found the research more interesting than I thought it would be. I
            started applying the techniques early on and reaching for different
            resources that I never got to use for my old uni essays (ted talks,
            podcasts) and it made writing them really fun. Im pretty self
            indulgent when it comes to yabbering on about nothing so that was
            nice. Not having to reference or write to structure is lovely.
          </p>
          <h2>
            <b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b>

            Trying to find personal examples derived from experiences I haven't

            Human skills are as important as tech skills in this industry. Even
            more so now people are moving back into the office and AI is
            changing how people get hired. They help shape the learning proccess
            and the earlier they are learned and reinforced with reflection the
            more helpful and permanent the learning will be. It also offers a
            pleasant alternative to the tech work, gives that learning time to
            settle while we get a break, but also stay present and learning and
            keeping up with our commitments to maintaining nuero-plasticity.
          </p>
          <h2>
            <b
              >Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a

          </h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes there are subjects that we spend too long on that could be
            made simpler. For instance I think EQ vs IQ can be summed up in a
            few paragraphs. Not a few hours. I feel like we could cut half of
            some of the more bumbling essays and maybe study industry structure
            and jargon instead. Or debugging. Or how to integrate AI into our
            learning. Or particularly sticky bits of coding technique that would
            make more sense with a little delving.
          </p>
          <h2>
            <b
              >Should you have just used that time to practise programming
              instead? Justify your answer.</b

          </h2>
          <p>
            Core and tech both need to be respected. I generally switch to core
            because I feel like a having a break from code but I don’t want to
            stop. If I stayed programing through that time instead it would be
            bad for my brain and bad for my code. I want to gain as many skills
            as possible while I’m training and neglecting half the training
            matter would really hinder that. Plus you never know what useful
            rabbit hole you can find until you go looking. There is time for
            everything.
