      <h2><b>OBJECTIVE 1: An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</b>
      </h2>
      <p>Creating a website is like building a house. </p>
      <p>HTML is your structural blueprint - it tells 
      you where the doors and windows go (via site navigation, links and images) designates areas 
      for further development (with headings like < h1 > Kitchen </ h1 >) and when followed will 
      create a
       very functional, plain basic structure. </p>
       <p>
      CSS is your interior designer, it manages colour schemes and makes sure your art is framed just
       the right way and sat in just the right place. It make sure that your design fits the rules of 
       cross compatible functionality and aesthetic satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>Javascript is your pack of tradies that comes in and makes sure theres water flowing in the 
      pipes and electricity running to every switch. The tradies animate the space by providing 
      areas where people can interact with the house, adding on/off switches and appliances that 
      make the space infinitely more useful. 
    </p>
    <p>The DOM is the site Foreman - the Foreman is able to understand the three pillars of the 
      building process and is able to structure the building plans in a way that allows all three 
      of them to understand each other and interact. </p>
      <p>The DOM is able to influence all aspects of 
      the build, adjust the plans from the outside if necessary and allows all parties involved 
      in building the house to tweak one-another's work for optimum performance.  </p>
      <p>It particularly 
      helps facilitate the tradies who come in at the latter stage of the build and allows them to
       pinpoint exactly what parts of the house need to be worked on (the HTML blueprint includes 
       markers that will need activation via code in order to become useful, like wall sockets that 
       will need wiring and light sockets that will need to be functionally linked to on/off 
       switches to become useful, and pinpad security alarms that will need to be programmed 
       to only respond to a specific input code) </p>
      <h2><b>OBJECTIVE 2: Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</b> </h2>
      <p>The Document Object Model allows javascript and CSS to style and activate the structure that is 
      created using html code.  </p>
      <p>
      The DOM transcribes HTML into a logic structure that allows javascript to read and alter whats 
      happening on the page its designing.  </p>
      <p>It does this by understanding how the starting tags (< p >) 
        and the ending tags (< /p >) within HTML contain specific data with specific purposes, and it 
        uses tags, like ID, type and class to link that data to the changes being made in the 
        javascript. </p>
        <p>Javascript adds functionality like being able to react to a mouse click, alter the HTMLs style, 
      changes its properties and understands the objects being created and manipulated by the code. 
      For every HTML script there is a DOM file that allows javascript to act on it and react to it, 
      we make this happen by changing the methods, properties and sub objects with the DOM.  </p>
      <p>One particularly vital facet of interactivity is when javascript uses eventlisteners. 
      Eventlisteners give javascript the ability to trigger certain code functions based on user 
      driven events like a mouse double clicking a button. This is vital in web design and only 
      able to happen when theres clear communication between the HTML and javascript, as the button 
      would be an HTML object, but its ability to be activated and the code pathway it would follow 
      once activated would be all javascript driven. </p>
  
      <h2><b>OBJECTIVE 3:Explain what functions are and why they are helpful. </b></h2>
        <p>In javascript a function is a piece of code that actively changes the outcome of another. 
      A function must be called on to begin running and performs a task immediately upon its 
      execution. </p>
      <p>Functions are useful for many reasons - once they have been defined in code they can be 
      called upon to do the same task as many times as theyre needed  - this saves repetitive 
      coding. </p>
      <p>They can receive a variety of variables and perform many different processing activities 
      depending on what code is written into them - they are capable of housing conditional 
      statements (ie producing an outcome that can help redirect the flow of the code in a 
      completely different direction if needed) and generally are the pieces of code where 
      the most change and action happens. </p>
      <h2><b>OBJECTIVE 4:Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 
      'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those) </b></h2>
      <p>By default javascript executes from top to bottom, line by line, which is good and 
      logical 
      but not practical once you start making complex programmes.  </p>
      <p>Code needs to be flexible and 
      applicable to many different sets of circumstances and often we need to have our code make 
      choices about how it will behave based on the information it gathers as it runs. </p>
      <p>We use conditional statements where we ask our code to generate one outcome if a 
      certain condition is met, and a completely different one if its not, and loops where we 
      apply similar code repetitively to an array of items to help sort them or process all of 
      them in a specific way. The code runs and processes, making decisions as it goes and calculates 
      its own pathway to one of many outcomes.  </p>
      <p>When we talk about control flow we’re talking about the way we build our code to 
      execute certain sections and pass over certain sections depending on whatever 
      input it has taken in. It is the control we have over the codes decision making 
      processes that we build in and means we can refine the codes functionality and efficiency.  </p>
      <p>If we were writing a code to help us decide have for dessert for tonight we would apply 
      control flow to the decision making process in many ways - perhaps first asking ourselves 
      if we’re hungry and want it (if not then skip dessert) if we have options, what we feel like 
      having and how healthy we need to be.  </p>
      <p>If there are dessert options a variety of loops could 
      be applied to the options depending on what your snacking criteria is - if someone is 
      hungry and healthy a loop could be applied to find the biggest healthiest dessert option,  </p>
      <p>if someone is hungry, doesn't care about health and a different loop could check all 
      the possible dessert options and deliver the largest most calorically dense portion.  </p>
      
      <h2><b>OBJECTIVE 5: Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</b></h2>
      <p>An array is a list of data, like [10,17,19] or [Chicken’, ‘Pork’, ‘Lamb’] </p>
      <p>It can hold any sort of data (integers, mixed data varieties, strings, objects) and allows for 
      large lists of information to be passed around a code and processed en masse. Containing data 
      in arrays has many benefits in coding - mostly because once in an array it is easy to us code to 
      go through each piece of data in and array and analyse or change it without having to modify each 
      piece individually.  </p>
      <p>Arrays are flexible and can be any length and can be manipulated easily with 
      code.  </p>
      <p>An object is a single structured thing that has multiple established variables and methods 
      that all help 
      define the objects functionality in the code. If we have a group of objects with similarly 
      structured variables it 
      makes it much easier to manipulate their data using arrays because you can ask an array to 
      iterate over a single facet of the object. </p>
      <p>Say you have 5 employees with different salaries, tax rates and names - your accounting code 
      would work by building a structured ‘employee’ object containing the three pieces of data. </p>
      <p>
      Once 
      the objects were defined it would be much easier to manipulate them with arrays - 
      say there was a payrise being pushed out to the whole business and you needed to know how much 
      extra money it would cost the business and whos tax rates would be effected.  </p>
      <p>If you were coding each 
      employee separately and treating their taxcodes and payrates as individual pieces of data you 
      would have to go to each individual persons file, first calculate the pay rise, then possible tax increase
       and then store and add up the extra money totals at the end. </p>
       <p>If you are storing their data as objects you could just write a loop that traverses the 
      whole company calculating the payrise and cost to the company, then a second loop that 
      checks on taxcodes, as opposed to the 15+ lines of new code you would have to generate 
      without grouping the data and variables.  </p>
