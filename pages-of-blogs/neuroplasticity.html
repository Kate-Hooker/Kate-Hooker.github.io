    </h1>

    <p>
      Neuroplasticity is the acknowledgement that our brains are eternally
      malleable, but we have to choose whether or not we unlock this.
    </p>
    <p>
      It helps us realise that it takes time to train, redirect and reinforce
      our neurons but if we can maintain a pattern of proactive study we can
      develop our minds in powerful ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      It also acknowledges that neuroplasticity can be influenced by much more
      than what we think of as classic book learning and intelligence - it is
      shaped by our thoughts, environment and lifestyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a physical level our neural pathways are like a huge twisting mass of
      roads and highways that information can travel down - as we start to learn
      new skills new paths are forged - delicate and breakable at first, but the
      more we use them the more the brain and body realises to reinforce them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we train our brain to know that every day we learn, and practise
      learning, it prepares itself to wire and strengthen those pathways faster
      but for this to happen practise, learning and self extension must be
      happening daily in our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is also why tests and reflections on our study materials are highly
      effective learning tools because they force us to review our own learning
      and re-ignite old neural pathways - re-strengthening them, but also
      building our awareness of our own abilities and knowledge to help promote
      dopamine release as a learning reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately this practise and repetition model can also work to our
      detriment when we fall into negative patterns, If we teach ourselves that
      all we want to do is lie down and watch netflix every day and memorise the
      spiralling details of some TV epic instead of practising an instrument or
      trying new things our brain will reinforce those pathways instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Negative self reinforcement can greatly hamper our potential if we allow
      the wrong pathways to be reinforced - part of training ourselves to learn
      every day is convincing our brains to fire off their chemical reward
      systems to keep us loving life and learning. If we accidently condition
      ourselves to believe we have limitations where we don’t, those pathways
      become reinforced and those limitations become genuine - if we tell
      ourselves we cannot learn, we will not try, and we will not learn - and
      everytime that pathway becomes reinforced our self inflicted barriers
      become denser and stronger and harder to break.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mind has amazing abilities to limit what we can and cannot do - did
      you know when people are in comas they can do the splits? We are all
      completely capable of the flexibility required to make it safely
      achievable but our brains have a designated stop-point that will freeze
      our muscle at a certain point in a stretch when we hit our perceived
      flexibility limited. In order to learn how to do it we have to slowly
      consistently move our muscles to that edge and gently relax into
      stretching further and further each time so our brain agrees to withdraws
      that barrier and allow us to perform at our full potential.
    </p>

    <p>
      This mindset effect makes understanding the principals of neuroplasticity
      even more important - people that understand that they are innately
      capable of learning and fostering their own high level intelligence leaves
      them open and able to do so.
    </p>

    <p>
      This growth mindset where we practise having an open attitude to learning
      becomes particularly powerful as we evolve to treat learning as a journey,
      and accept that the most rewarding journeys are never the easiest ones.
      This mindset teaches that pitfalls, failures and challenges are all
      opportunities for further development and growth. The harder we work for
      success the bigger the dopamine hit at the end, and the more our human
      capabilities expand. It reminds us that effort is necessary for later
      reward, and critiques of our work are only meant to be helpful. We must
      reframe challenge, and not let anything hold back our growth - especially
      if it is just poor thinking practise.
    </p>

    <p>
      So knowing all this what are some easy ways to incorporate this into our
      learning practises to make our learning journeys more efficient and
      productive?
    </p>

    <p>
      As we push ourselves struggles and challenges are inevitable - we must
      reframe perceived ‘failures’ and see them as learning opportunities and
      reasons to seek help from experts and delve deeper.
    </p>

    <p>
      Associating guilt and failure with learning is a really bad practise. This
      is where a good understanding of mindfulness will come in handy (fielding
      those negative thoughts and sorting out the ones that serve no good
      purpose) and is also where a learning journal can be really helpful - it
      tracks incremental success and gives a really nice frame of reference to
      those days where you just feel like you’re going nowhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using whatever access we have to our learning peers, and building lines of
      communication with connections that have been through similar training can
      also be greatly beneficial here - everybody has different strategies for
      coping with this feeling and inevitabley reaching out for help, support or
      advice will help you access these resources.
    </p>

    <p>
      Learning journals are also great for nailing down old techniques that have
      worked in the past and help you revisit them when your stuck.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are plenty of ways to hack neuroplasticity once you get into the
      science behind it - experimenting with a variety of learning techniques is
      a really good one (essays, podcasts, videos, talking about the subject
      live) because as soon as one begins to feel cumbersome or perplexing you
      can switch to a new learning medium and reinforce a slightly different
      pathway without risking andy negative reinforcement and still developing
      your learning and growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m a big fan of brain boosting nootropics - go for anything that boosts
      brain cell growth and memory. I take lions mane (builds the neural sheafs
      that protect your neurons much faster that your body can naturally, I
      would take cordyceps if I could afford them (speeds up DNA synthesis
      throughout the body, including the brain) and I take a spearmint extract
      that has a significant effect on long term memory development, and fish
      oil to keep my neural cell membranes healthy.
    </p>

    <p>
      I practise a variety of mindfulness activities - yoga meditation, Wim
      Hoff, all that good stuff, take breaks, live a very low toxin life to keep
      my synapses in good shape and I only watch trash on the internet for truly
      medicinal purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because everybody needs a little lazy dopamine mining system somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>Staying stimulated is key. Use it or lose it.</p>
    <p>
      Learning everyday or practising something that powers your brain up is
      key.
    </p>
    <p>We have the ability to never stop evolving - why wouldn't we?<br /></p>
