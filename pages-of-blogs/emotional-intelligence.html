    </h4>

    <p>
      <br />
      Intelligence quotient treats the human mind like a calculator - it is a
      quantifiable rating that reflects how well you can use logic and reason to
      solve problems. <br /><br /><br />It used to be sort of a big deal - back
      before we had smartphones as our built-in memory drives, the ability to
      spit out facts and do math used to mean something. But now we keep out
      android tech comfortably installed in our pockets there's a new
      intelligence rising, and it’s something our phones can’t do for us.<br /><br />
      Emotional intelligence is a powerful skill. It allows us to consider our
      emotional response to stimuli separately, before we react to it, and
      choose to force our reactions through a different filter if our initial
      reaction doesn’t serve us. <br /><br />It makes us resilient,
      compassionate, pragmatic and level headed, and combined with a solid IQ
      becomes a very very potent social tool.<br /><br /><br />

      IQ is quantifiable and covers learnt skills like mathematics, spatial
      reasoning, recall and logic, but as technology clears time as space for us
      to perform higher learning it has become far less powerful than the social
      grace gifted to us by emotional intelligence. <br /><br />EQ spans a much
      deeper understanding of the human condition, it teaches us new levels of
      patience, analytical understanding of ourselves and others and gives us
      far greater control over our communication and actions.
      <br /><br /><br />At its root EQ allows us to recognise rogue emotion and
      helps us navigate it so we can achieve a clearer decision making process
      and engage in communication shaped with empathy and human understanding.
      This self regulation and self awareness leads us towards a cleaner mental
      function and better decision making.<br /><br /><br />It seems people
      often mistake EQ for something that is emotionally driven - it is really
      using logic to recognise and reorder emotion as it occurs and judge
      weither or not it is serving our decision making process at the time.
      <br /><br /><br />When I was learning to meditate one of the key practises
      starting out was learning how to deal with visiting emotion during
      sessions (which should be clear, empty time, but its rarely perfect -
      nobodies perfect, its OK) in quiet moments of stilling the mind we learnt
      to acknowledge emotion and thoughts as they rose but then to trust
      ourselves that they served no purpose and let them go immediately.
      <br /><br />This acknowledgement and self acceptance gives you a deeper
      sense of peace and helps you trust yourself more and get even better a
      stilling your mind.<br /><br /><br />
      When you feel the anger bubble up inside of you because someone left the
      door open when they left the flat last night and the lounge is now a balmy
      6 degrees celcius this morning, take a moment. <br /><br />You have
      several paths you could go down from here. <br /><br /><br />Path one:
      listen to your adrenal system, the path where its 7am, you haven’t had
      coffee and you’re propper pissed off: <br /><br />The immediate anger and
      stress fills you with raging epinephrine, cortisol, and norepinephrine,
      your blood pressure rises, you heart rate quickens, your body spikes its
      need for sugars and your flight or fight nodes switch on as your lizard
      brain readies itself for combat. <br /><br />Even though it only takes a
      few minutes to process the adrenaline and a few hours to work through the
      cortisol if anything else stresses you before your body and hormone levels
      return to normal your levels will spike back up to prime stress.
      <br /><br />You’ve just let your flatmate ruin your day and if you go dip
      into that coffee its going to smash your hormones even more.
      <br /><br />Without emotional regulation you stay mad, you get stuck in
      traffic on the way to work and end up staying pissed off until you put
      yourself with a food coma at lunch and chill. <br /><br />When your body
      is in alarm phase it puts loads of vital processing on hold - you burn
      through extra oxygen, and any energy being directed to recovery and
      healing is repurposed and used for your stress response. <br /><br />You
      feel pain more intensely and any conditions or ailments you have get worse
      - migraines, muscular issues, old injuries, back pain, the blood sugar
      disruptions inhibit your immune systems and wreck your appetite, sending
      you into a deep sugar craving mode, or a fasting state to keep your more
      agile and mentally aware. <br /><br />The blood pressure fluctuations
      effect your tissues and heart. And the hormone fluctuations make you a
      real dickhead to be around. <br /><br /><br />Path two: recognise your
      adrenal system is about to kick off, because its 7am and you haven’t had
      coffee, put the heat pump on blast and treat yourself to a hot shower.<br /><br />
      I won’t write a story but you can leave the door open if you want and
      maliciously freeze the bastard out, calmy, comfortably, knowing karma is a
      good bitch and you’re going to have a lovely day.<br /><br />Or you can
      leave the heat pump on and he buys you a beer after work to say sorry.
      <br /><br />Either way, hormonally and karmically speaking, you just won.
      <br /><br /><br />Practising EQ during everyday life teaches us to do this
      with all emotions, we greet them when they show up, check what they’re
      going to do and process them effectively - we learn our triggers, we learn
      to know what emotions will trigger in us and learn to think ahead a few
      steps and decide whether or not they serve us before we process them.
      <br /><br />Eventually we learn how to perform the same emotional
      dissection on others (empathy might be a nicer word for that) using
      compassion as we’re analysing their actions, and our reactions before we
      proceed with interacting. <br /><br /><br />Amongst many things this helps
      regulate unnecessary stress, replace split second judgements with empathy
      and pragmatism and generally be more open to alternate interpretations of
      the situations we find ourselves instead of just following the chemical
      roller-coaster that our flight and sight systems can send us on.
      <br /><br />As someone that used to be particularly ruled by my adrenal
      system I can particularly relate to this. <br /><br /><br />By
      understanding our flaws, patterns and knee jerk responses we can develop
      techniques and call ourselves on our own negative repeat behaviours,
      reinforce positive neural pathways and evolve to be better.
      <br /><br /><br />I recently learnt an interesting technique for imposter
      syndrome (and for quieting that inner critic that we’ve been asked to
      journal about so frequently) where in times of self doubt when the
      internal forces are being your enemy you single each one out and imagine
      is as a single entity, personify them, give them a voice. Choose the
      loudest, rudest, most distinct one first, and imagine it turning into a
      tiny ugly mouse and put it in a jar. <br /><br />There’s a volume button
      on the jar - turn the volume right up, listen to the shrieking mouse
      telling you how to think, then turn it right down until its completely
      silent and just screaming into the ether. <br /><br />Take a moment to
      relish their silence... Now go to the next, turn it into a mouse and
      continue the process until they’re all gone. <br /><br />Then focus.
      <br /><br /><br />Its a weird one but its pretty shocking how much you can
      let pointless external influences effect your private inner workings when
      you look under the surface for a little. <br /><br /><br />There are
      hundreds of techniques. <br /><br />
      Find what works for you. <br /><br /><br />EQ is exceptionally important
      in hierarchical work places - jobs can be taught, and a genuine interest
      in upskilling can be as much of a positive as already being fluent if you
      can show you would be a great hire. <br /><br />The ability to be a level,
      pleasant human being that works well as part of a team is actually much
      harder for some people to master than the actual skills they need to do
      their jobs. <br /><br />
      And some people are assholes, clever assholes, but still assholes.
      <br /><br />People skills, networking, confidence, the ability to manage
      nerves, stress, pressure will get you much further in a job interview than
      the ability to flash cram python into your head. <br /><br />So use this
      knowledge and remember to check yourself. And check in with yourself.
      <br /><br />Use your IQ to boost your EQ and put your enemies in a mouse
      jar. <br />Leave the heat pump on and only drink coffee when you actually
      need it. <br /><br />Breath.<br />Chill. <br />And don’t stress too much.
      <br /><br /><br />Nobodies perfect, but we can always be a little bit
      better if we try.
      <br /><br /><br /><br />&#11090;Namaste&#11090;<br /><br /><br />
