    <p><b>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</b></p>

    <p>
      At this stage I am too new to the industry to be able to understand that.
      Obviously I want to find a path thats equally engaging and challenging - I
      am open to a wide range of ideas - I just want to see where I fit. I feel
      like I am coming in to this area with a minor disadvantage (being that
      most people who start at the academy already have a vast background in
      tech, where Im from a background where I think Ive used HTML once in my
      life to make a myspace background when I was 12, and haven’t had anything
      to do with it since) so I feel it would be a bit presumptuous to
      pigeon-hole myself without knowing anything about anything really. I’ve
      got a vague dream that I’d like to work for a place with a bit of a moral
      compass, but thats never really going to be a deciding factor in my job
      hunting, but more a side hobby once I’ve got some skills behind me. I want
      to use my flexibility and malleabiliity to my advantage - the rest is up
      to fate, luck and good networking.

        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </b>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Strengths:</b> stubborn, never giving up, very good at finding little
      glitches in my work, always delivering the best thing I possibly can. Eye
      for detail. Eye for useful cheats and an ear for tastey advice.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Weaknesses:</b> ADHD, learning from the ground up with a group of
      people that are much more advanced, prefer working face-to-face with other
      people - very much effected by positive spillover in the workplace (ie
      when working with highly productive people makes me more productive) can
      get a bit obsessed over details, am currently working on a little
      chromebook that will definitely be overwelmed soon.

        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </b>
    </p>

    <p>
      I would like to develop my office manor, people skills and willingness to
      ask for help. I would like more knowlege about how teams are structured
      and standard working hierarchies function in the industry and be ready to
      seamlessly join them. I would like a deep understanmding of terminology,
      shorthand and industry slang. I would also like to develop a better idea
      of where I will fit in the industry.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives
      </b>
    </p>

    <p>
      By frequently pushing versions to git hub, respecting job hierarchy, being
      very respectful of code on the main branch, being consistently available
      during study hours, respecting deadlines, asking for help, sticking to
      time guidelines, using discord to its fullest and being very respectful of
      meeting times, I will be honest with my teammates about my strengths and
      weakness and what I want to learn, and encourage them to do the same and
      know that we are all in a safe learning psace together where we respect
      everybodies position.

        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?
      </b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Find ways to circumnavigate my problems, asking other coursemates what
      they have done to strategize, using shortcuts and quick fixes where
      appropriate, being constantly aware of what the achievement criteria and
      curriculum goals are. Paying close note to timing recommendations.

        >A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</b

    </p>

    <p>
      I will ask discord if AI can’t help me or if Im really pushed for time. I
      really appreciate how the flipped learning model allows for us to learn at
      our own pace and I will certainly need to work a bit slower than everybody
      else because I am an absolute beginner. I don't mind asking for help but
      its just so much more delicious when you can find the answer yourself.
      Successful problem solving is the little dopamine hit I need when I'm
      stuck for a while. I'm fully aware the academy provides resources to help
      us but that sweet sweet serotonin of success and autonomy is just so
      tasty.
    </p>

    <p><b>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</b></p>

    <p>
      The only thing I’m really concerned about is how un-beginner friendly the
      teaching methods have been so far. I hope the rest of the curriculum feels
      more inclusive. I was expecting more guided learning and less free online
      tutorials.

        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things.
      </b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Nothing major - I’m good at making my meetings, if you can find me during
      course hours I’m probably eating. I'm prioritising this course above
      everything else while I'm here and already have a very mindfulness based
      lifestyle and strict schedules that I like to work to so while I am
      enrolled and completing this curriculum I will be structuring my life
      around this. If I'm truely unreachable for more than 10minutes during the
      day I am probably having a suprise nap or emergency yoga, in this rare
      case rest assured this break will make for more pleasant interactions for
      all parties involved 90 minutes later.
