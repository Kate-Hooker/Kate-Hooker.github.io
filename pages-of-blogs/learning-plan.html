    <h2><b>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</b></h2>
    <p>
    Since I’m coming into this fresh from admin and hospitality I have very little understanding 
    of what options will be open to me after this. I have really enjoyed the design aspect of 
    melding html and javascript and css, but I have no idea how I could apply that. My career 
    goals are malleable. I want to work in a sphere that is good for me, I want somewhere I can
     grow and develop, and somewhere with a culture that has space for me. At this stage I don’t 
     mind what work I do - I would be particularly stoked if I get to use lots of cool AI on the
      daily because I just find it fascinating, but would be just as happy writing analogue code, 
      debugging or doing anything that keeps me interested and learning. 
      </p>
      <p>
    Learning is key. I don’t want a role where I feel stagnant but I do accept 
    that a lot of entry level positions may feel stagnant for a while - that’s where 
    the company culture comes in. If the culture isn’t right, and the work isn’t letting me grow, 
    I would compromise if the work was for something that I really believe in. If I really dug the 
    cause I was grinding for I would happily work for less and learn in my own time. 
    It really all just depends what’s out there for me when I start looking.
    </p>
    <h2><b>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</b></h2>
    <p> Learning with other people is going to be a completely different experience from foundations. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a bit worried I will be nervous about the first few collabs (I have this silly thing where 
      I get nervous if people start watching me work over my shoulder - maybe screen sharing will
       be better) 
      </p>
      <p>I think my drive and dedication will be a strength - I’m a big team player and 
       I think boosting the vibe and looking after your team is a big part of successful 
       collaboration. 
      </p>
      <p>
    When I’m working on group projects I am very careful about keeping pace with the pack and 
    the project, I will happily pull extra hours to do this. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a bit worried that I could end up being a bit run down but I have been very mindful 
    of taking breaks and getting into good study habits so far. </p>
    <p>
    I am worried if I fall behind it will be much harder to catch up and I will let my workmmates 
    down. 
    </p>
    <h2><b>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</b></h2>
    <p>
     Am also worried that I have never done this style collaboration work with people over the 
     internet and I’m not sure my technology is going to hold up so well. Dealing with a lagging
      laptop and bad coms isn’t something I should be putting my workmates through and I would 
      hate to get a reputation for being someone that is bad to work with. 
    </p>
    <h2><b>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b></h2>
    <p>
    I need to work on asking for help when I need it and not relying so heavily on AI to sort 
    out all my problems for me. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I think I will also need to learn how to give feedback without being too nice - I often avoid
     critiquing other people because I feel bad about giving negative feedback but I think through 
     this process it will be vital. 
    </p>
    <h2><b>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</b></h2>
    <p>
    I would like them to help us develop a really firm idea about what to expect once we have finished
     this course so we can focus our personal practises so we specifically end up where we want to. 
     I would like my understanding of the industry, role structures and baseline opportunities to be
      much more developed by the time I am getting ready to finish and leave, and I would like to be 
      encouraged down a path that my skills are suited to. 
    </p>
    <h2><b>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</b></h2>
    <p>
    I will manage my problem solving very differently once I start working collaboratively. I will 
    operate usings a full transparency model and let my groupmates know almost immediately if I am
     getting stuck. I will build my code with pseudocode that explains my process and tests that 
     allow for quick debugging and careful data tracking. I will commit frequently and use 
     standardised communication platforms to ake sure I am keeping pace with my group or partner. 

      </p>

      </center>
    </h1>

    <h2><b>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</b></h2>

    <p>
      At this stage I am too new to the industry to be able to understand that.
      Obviously I want to find a path thats equally engaging and challenging - I
      am open to a wide range of ideas - I just want to see where I fit. I feel
      like I am coming in to this area with a minor disadvantage (being that
      most people who start at the academy already have a vast background in
      tech, where Im from a background where I think Ive used HTML once in my
      life to make a myspace background when I was 12, and haven’t had anything
      to do with it since) so I feel it would be a bit presumptuous to
      pigeon-hole myself without knowing anything about anything really. I’ve
      got a vague dream that I’d like to work for a place with a bit of a moral
      compass, but thats never really going to be a deciding factor in my job
      hunting, but more a side hobby once I’ve got some skills behind me. I want
      to use my flexibility and malleabiliity to my advantage - the rest is up
      to fate, luck and good networking.

    <h2>
      <b>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </b>
    </h2>

    <p>
      <b>Strengths:</b> stubborn, never giving up, very good at finding little
      glitches in my work, always delivering the best thing I possibly can. Eye
      for detail. Eye for useful cheats and an ear for tastey advice.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Weaknesses:</b> ADHD, learning from the ground up with a group of
      people that are much more advanced, prefer working face-to-face with other
      people - very much effected by positive spillover in the workplace (ie
      when working with highly productive people makes me more productive) can
      get a bit obsessed over details, am currently working on a little
      chromebook that will definitely be overwelmed soon.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <b>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </b>
    </h2>

    <p>
      I would like to develop my office manor, people skills and willingness to
      ask for help. I would like more knowlege about how teams are structured
      and standard working hierarchies function in the industry and be ready to
      seamlessly join them. I would like a deep understanmding of terminology,
      shorthand and industry slang. I would also like to develop a better idea
      of where I will fit in the industry.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <b>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives
      </h2>
    </p>

    <p>
      By frequently pushing versions to git hub, respecting job hierarchy, being
      very respectful of code on the main branch, being consistently available
      during study hours, respecting deadlines, asking for help, sticking to
      time guidelines, using discord to its fullest and being very respectful of
      meeting times, I will be honest with my teammates about my strengths and
      weakness and what I want to learn, and encourage them to do the same and
      know that we are all in a safe learning psace together where we respect
      everybodies position.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <b>
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?
      </b>
    </h2>

    <p>
      Find ways to circumnavigate my problems, asking other coursemates what
      they have done to strategize, using shortcuts and quick fixes where
      appropriate, being constantly aware of what the achievement criteria and
      curriculum goals are. Paying close note to timing recommendations.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <b>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</b>
    </h2>

    <p>
      I will ask discord if AI can’t help me or if Im really pushed for time. I
      really appreciate how the flipped learning model allows for us to learn at
      our own pace and I will certainly need to work a bit slower than everybody
      else because I am an absolute beginner. I don't mind asking for help but
      its just so much more delicious when you can find the answer yourself.
      Successful problem solving is the little dopamine hit I need when I'm
      stuck for a while. I'm fully aware the academy provides resources to help
      us but that sweet sweet serotonin of success and autonomy is just so
      tasty.
    </p>

    <h2><b>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</b></h2>

    <p>
      The only thing I’m really concerned about is how un-beginner friendly the
      teaching methods have been so far. I hope the rest of the curriculum feels
      more inclusive. I was expecting more guided learning and less free online
      tutorials.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <b>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things.
      </b>
    </h2>

    <p>
      Nothing major - I’m good at making my meetings, if you can find me during
      course hours I’m probably eating. I'm prioritising this course above
      everything else while I'm here and already have a very mindfulness based
      lifestyle and strict schedules that I like to work to so while I am
      enrolled and completing this curriculum I will be structuring my life
      around this. If I'm truely unreachable for more than 10minutes during the
      day I am probably having a suprise nap or emergency yoga, in this rare
      case rest assured this break will make for more pleasant interactions for
      all parties involved 90 minutes later.
