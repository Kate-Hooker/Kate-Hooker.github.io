        Te Whare Tapa Whā is a holistic approach to wellbeing incorporating taha
        tinana (the physical) taha hinengaro (the emotional and mental) taha
        wairua (the spiritual) and taha whānau ( the wellbeing of ones family)
      </p>
      <p class="pad">
        These 4 dimensions are often represented by the 4 walls of a whare thats
        rests upon strong roots, the whenua, the 5th key element of this model
        that links environment, sense of belonging and identity, to an
        individuals wellness.

      <p class="pad">
        The following commitments constitute my wellbeing plan based on these
        concepts.

        I take great care of my health and wellbeing - I’m a devout yogi (at the
        studio 5 days a week) and schedule my life around this practise. I
        mostly practise very early in the morning and smash a massive breakfast
        and a tonne of water as soon as I get home.
      </p>
      <p class="pad">
        I pre-plan and batch cook my meals so I know I have awesome balanced kai
        ready to go, have a strict nootropic and vitamin regiment that I follow
        and stay well away from delicious intoxicants like alcohol and coffee,
        mostly due to an unfortunate dopamine fast that went really well for me.
      </p>

          <b>Taha Hinengaro <em>Emotional & Mental Wellbeing</em></b>
        </center>
      </h3>

      <p class="pad">Yoga helps a lot with my state of mind.</p>
      <p class="pad">
        I also follow pretty strict daily routines to keep me from letting ADHD
        knock me too far off track. I’ve learnt that I feel quite guilty for
        breaking routines, and end up way happier and healthier if I stick to
        them so I do.
      </p>
      <p class="pad">
        When I wake up I make my bed and leave the house as fast as I possibly
        can. Natural light is amazing for mental health - I listen to a podcast
        on my way to yoga to wake my brain up and have a little company (I know
        it sounds a little sad but I get up early and theres never anyone to
        talk to so the entertainment really helps)
      </p>
      <p class="pad">
        I clear my head, run through my practise, suss my daily meditation and
        listen to the news on my way home so I can feel a bit more connected to
        the world.
      </p>
      <p class="pad">
        I socialise a lot and treat myself well. When I take breaks I always
        make sure its worthwhile - I always have a project to work on, or
        something nice to do for myself, I look after my plants, and I let
        myself rest a lot. I also forgive myself for resting, and for not being
        good at routines sometimes, because nobody's perfect and taking a cold
        shower everyday is actually pretty difficult in winter sometimes. Little
        slip ups just aren't worth the cortisol load. Forgive, eat some cheese
        and keep going.
      </p>
      <p class="pad">
        I also try and encourage the people around me to be really mindful and
        chill as well - going for a saunas so much nicer if you’re taking a
        friend that needs it just as badly as you do, cooking a nice meal feels
        twice as good if you’re going to share it and starting a news projects
        even more satisfying if you’ve got someone to share the memory with.

      <p class="pad">
        I don’t consider myself a spiritual person but I do like to feel
        connected to my communities.
      </p>
      <p class="pad">
        For me spiritual wellbeing is a deep sense of peace that I get from
        living a whole and satisfying life and feeling like I’ve been making
        good choices. I nurture it by learning, growing and giving myself
        creative tasks that allow me to feel like I’ve bought some good energy
        into the world.

      <p class="pad">
        I don’t have much family in Wellington but I really like being around my
        urban tribe.
      </p>
      <p class="pad">
        Being social and making sure my people are healthy, respected and
        receive the same care that they give is very important to me. Also
        standing with them when times aren’t so great. I extend the same
        forgiveness I give myself to my friends and family. Nobodies perfect,
        but they can still be wonderful.

      </h3>
      <p class="pad">
        I go to nature to recharge. I live in the city and this place feels so
        tiny sometimes - I find wide open space really great for a recharge and
        I’m constantly surprised by how beautiful Wellington can be. I go to the
        beach a lot, and I walk around Wellington all the time (because I dont
        have a car, but also its my guaranteed break from screens, designated
        podcast time and the serenity and space is so healing)
      </p>
      <p class="pad">I find a massive solace in stargazing and gardening.</p>
      <p class="pad">
        My sense of whenua comes from being here for half my life - I have so
        many special spaces I love to visit and secret tracks I can follow to
        visit old memories, an I always actively try to find more. I love
        Wellington so much I really think this is the perfect city for me.

      <p class="pad">Theres so much beauty here.</p>
