      <br />
      Te Whare Tapa Whā is a holistic approach to wellbeing incorporating taha
      tinana (the physical) taha hinengaro (the emotional and mental) taha
      wairua (the spiritual) and taha whānau ( the wellbeing of ones family)
      <br />
      <br />
      These 4 dimensions are often represented by the 4 walls of a whare thats
      rests upon strong roots, the whenua, the 5th key element of this model
      that links environment, sense of belonging and identity, to an individuals
      wellness. <br />
      <br />

      The following commitments constitute my wellbeing plan based on these
      concepts. <br />

    <p>
      I take great care of my health and wellbeing - I’m a devout yogi (at the
      studio 5 days a week) and schedule my life around this practise. I mostly
      practise very early in the morning and smash a massive breakfast and a
      tonne of water as soon as I get home. <br /><br />I pre-plan and batch
      cook my meals so I know I have awesome balanced kai ready to go, have a
      strict nootropic and vitamin regiment that I follow and stay well away
      from delicious intoxicants like alcohol and coffee, mostly due to an
      unfortunate dopamine fast that went really well for me.

    <br />
    <p>
      Yoga helps a lot with my state of mind.<br /><br />
      I also follow pretty strict daily routines to keep me from letting ADHD
      knock me too far off track. I’ve learnt that I feel quite guilty for
      breaking routines, and end up way happier and healthier if I stick to them
      so I do. <br /><br />When I wake up I make my bed and leave the house as
      fast as I possibly can. Natural light is amazing for mental health - I
      listen to a podcast on my way to yoga to wake my brain up and have a
      little company (I know it sounds a little sad but I get up early and
      theres never anyone to talk to so the entertainment really helps)
      <br /><br />I clear my head, run through my practise, suss my daily
      meditation and listen to the news on my way home so I can feel a bit more
      connected to the world. <br /><br />I socialise a lot and treat myself
      well. When I take breaks I always make sure its worthwhile - I always have
      a project to work on, or something nice to do for myself, I look after my
      plants, and I let myself rest a lot. I also forgive myself for resting,
      and for not being good at routines sometimes, because nobody's perfect and
      taking a cold shower everyday is actually pretty difficult in winter
      sometimes. Little slip ups just aren't worth the cortisol load. Forgive,
      eat some cheese and keep going. <br /><br />I also try and encourage the
      people around me to be really mindful and chill as well - going for a
      saunas so much nicer if you’re taking a friend that needs it just as badly
      as you do, cooking a nice meal feels twice as good if you’re going to
      share it and starting a news projects even more satisfying if you’ve got
      someone to share the memory with. <br /><br /><br /><br />

        <b>Taha Wairua <em>Spiritual Wellbeing</em></b>

    </h4>
    <br />
    <p>
      I don’t consider myself a spiritual person but I do like to feel connected
      to my communities. <br /><br />For me spiritual wellbeing is a deep sense
      of peace that I get from living a whole and satisfying life and feeling
      like I’ve been making good choices. I nurture it by learning, growing and
      giving myself creative tasks that allow me to feel like I’ve bought some
      good energy into the world. <br /><br /><br /><br />

    <br />
    <p>
      I don’t have much family in Wellington but I really like being around my
      urban tribe. <br /><br />Being social and making sure my people are
      healthy, respected and receive the same care that they give is very
      important to me. Also standing with them when times aren’t so great. I
      extend the same forgiveness I give myself to my friends and family.
      Nobodies perfect, but they can still be wonderful.

      </center>
    </h4>
    <br />
    <p>
      I go to nature to recharge. I live in the city and this place feels so
      tiny sometimes - I find wide open space really great for a recharge and
      I’m constantly surprised by how beautiful Wellington can be. I go to the
      beach a lot, and I walk around Wellington all the time (because I dont
      have a car, but also its my guaranteed break from screens, designated
      podcast time and the serenity and space is so healing) <br /><br />I find
      a massive solace in stargazing and gardening.<br /><br />
      My sense of whenua comes from being here for half my life - I have so many
      special spaces I love to visit and secret tracks I can follow to visit old
      memories, an I always actively try to find more. I love Wellington so much
      I really think this is the perfect city for me. <br /><br />
      Theres so much beauty here.<br /><br />
