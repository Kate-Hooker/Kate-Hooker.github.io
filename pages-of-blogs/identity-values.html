    <p>
      Coming from a frugal hardworking background most of my values are drawn
      from treasuring new opportunities, inner strength and constant personal
      growth. I’m a minimalist - filtering most of my spare income into
      projects, experiments and experiences, enriching my lifes’ tapestry with
      the goal of evolving constantly instead of simply existing to buy new
      things.
    </p>

    <p>
      I particularly value creative thinkers - I think the world is saturated
      with amazing tools that allow people to expand their minds and it
      absolutely flaws me that people just dont use them.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <b>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision?</b>
    </h2>

    <p>
      I recently made the ethical decision not to go to a wedding and I still
      feel bad about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a general rule I don’t enjoy weddings - they’re a little archaic
      (giving away virgins etc) and a little bit culty, and a little bit sad
      that people have all pressure on them to drop a house deposit or a college
      fund on a big spangley party - also no disrespect to people that like them
      - its a nice party - I get it - they’re just not for me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anyway, I finally had one I actually wanted to go to - my ethical dilemma
      arose after I had accepted the invitation when they began advertising that
      there would be a second open bar available throughout the night serving
      pharmaceuticals and uppers, and I’m a full on sober t-totaller - not even
      caffeine, barely even sugar - sort of person.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having quit drinking a long time ago I don’t mind being around people that
      are having fun but substance abuse (particularly at the level being
      encouraged here) just feels quite monstrous to me and makes people really
      hard to talk to.
    </p>

    <p>
      I weighed up going in early and just staying for the start of it but I
      would have felt so rude leaving an hour in because of sobriety - I didn’t
      want to seem judgemental or feel out of place because it’s supposed to be
      a big free celebration of love.
    </p>

    <p>
      I weighed it up ethically and socially, reneged on the invitation and
      didn’t go.
    </p>

    <p>I feel bad, but I think it was better for everyone.</p>

    <p>Was I right? I don’t know.</p>

        Describe your culture and how the people around you have influenced your
        value and identity</b
      >
    </h2>

    <p>
      Like many people growing up in smalltown 90s New Zealand my hometown
      became the blue print for the lifestyle I never wanted to live, I used
      university as my excuse and got out fast.
    </p>

    <p>
      I came straight to Wellington and started at Vic and got (most) of an arts
      degree (Film and Psychology) and all of a film diploma (Yes, very funny)
    </p>

    <p>
      And did what anyone with a BA in people watching would do and started
      running bars in lieu of a real job. For 15 years.
    </p>

    <p>
      I did well in the industry because I was reliable, pragmatic, quick on my
      feet, good at fixing things, good at managing people, and socially
      connected to a point I could get most issues sorted before anybody else
      noticed there was a problem. I did well and had some great mentors.
    </p>

    <p>
      This industry taught me to value grit and humility above all. My values
      are firmly grounded in the realm of hardworking, down to earth, good
      people.
    </p>

    <p>
      I like problem solvers who have worked hard to get where they are, people
      that hunger to stay relevant and better themselves, and developed the key
      goal in life to remain hungry for development and betterment.
    </p>

    <p>
      also learnt a special respect for creatives that have learnt to apply
      their rampant creativity to a structure, make it marketable and monetize
      it.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <b>Identify your strengths that will support your learning journey?</b>
    </h2>

    <p>
      I’m driven, stubborn and competitive - I don’t mind competing with other
      people but I generally just compete with myself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beat my last score - take better notes this time - make a road map to
      solve this so next time I can get straight through it etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love jedi mind tricks and bio hacks for learning - I fully believe we
      can expand our comprehension and neuroplasticity by training our minds - I
      think it’s genuinely advantageous and I love using myself as a test
      subject.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m very curious and creative - I love harnessing my adhd and using it to
      my advantage. I can throw out a lot of solutions to a problem I understand
      properly and take criticism really well (because I know full well that 9
      out of those 10 solutions will be bad and thats all part of the process)
    </p>

    <p>
      I get equal satisfaction solving other peoples problems - I really like
      collaborating, even if its just being a sounding board. I think its a
      really special thing to help bump someone else onto the right path when
      they’re a bit stuck.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <b>Evaluate how your limitations may effect your learning journey?</b>
    </h2>

    <p>
      Burnnouts a bit of a risk - maybe the biggest. I feel like I’ve come into
      this with a lot less experience than a lot of the other participants have
      and I’m going to push myself pretty hard to stay relevant.
    </p>

    <p>I can push myself a little hard sometimes.</p>

    <p>
      I’m also potentially limited by the fact that I have very little
      experience working with code so it might take me a little longer to get
      used to than a lot of the other people on this course. And maybe a little
      imposter syndrome along with that but I’ll get over it.
    </p>

    <p>
      This can also make it a bit hard to ask questions on discord because, lets
      be real - there are LOADS of stupid questions. And nobody feels good about
      asking them. Luckily chat gpt doesn’t judge me so I’ll be going there
      first.
    </p>

    <p>
      My workspace poses some limitations - I’ve never had to put together a
      decent work from home space so I’ve got a deck chair, a chrome book and a
      TV to work with right now. I will work on this!
    </p>

      </b>
    </h2>

    <p>
      I was having some struggles at a job (office job, court clerk for the
      government, admin) because I was finding that the space was much too
      disruptive for me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think the tension arrose because my way of dealing with discomfort is
      blocking it out and ignoring it. My desk placement was opposite a person
      with a compulsive singing issue - when they had their airpods in and were
      in flow they would compulsively (badly) sing (/moan, hum, singing is a
      stretch, there weren't many words) along with anything they listened to,
      despite an office full of people asking them not to. In the darker hours
      other workmates would start to give in and join in bad sing-alongs to try
      lift the mood and the singer was very liked, and hardworking, so no
      negative comments were made. I think it might have been a comulsion tick
      so I didn't bring it up either.
    </p>

    <p>
      I can’t concentrate on work while there’s singing, I really really started
      to dislike it but I needed to stay seated with my team because I was still
      in training and they were the people I needed to help me learn. I tried
      listening to music but that would zone me out too much, and I felt like I
      was missing out on the social aspect of the office because it cut me off
      from all conversation.
    </p>

    <p>
      I tried timing my day so I wouldn’t overlap shifts and breaks with them,
      which helped a little, but in the end I resorted to just loading my phone
      with podcasts and sitting listening to those all afternoon to block out
      the ruckus. And while it may have made me seem a bit isolated from the
      team I’m 100% sure it kept me saner and much more productive.
    </p>

    <p>
      In hindsight I probably should have just asked them nicely to shut up, and
      asked to be moved somewhere quieter.
    </p>

    <p>
      But its hard to do that in a big environment where this behaviour is an
      established norm - nobody wants to be the fun police, and they were just
      young and trying to make the most of a crappy office.
