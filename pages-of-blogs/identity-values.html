    <p>
      <br />
      <br />Coming from a frugal hardworking background most of my values are
      drawn from treasuring new opportunities, inner strength and constant
      personal growth. I’m a minimalist - filtering most of my spare income into
      projects, experiments and experiences, enriching my lifes’ tapestry with
      the goal of evolving constantly instead of simply existing to buy new
      things. <br />
      <br />
      I particularly value creative thinkers - I think the world is saturated
      with amazing tools that allow people to expand their minds and it
      absolutely flaws me that people just dont use them. <br />
      <br /><br /><br />
      <b>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision?</b>
      <br /><br />I recently made the ethical decision not to go to a wedding
      and I still feel bad about it.<br /><br />
      As a general rule I don’t enjoy weddings - they’re a little archaic
      (giving away virgins etc) and a little bit culty, and a little bit sad
      that people have all pressure on them to drop a house deposit or a college
      fund on a big spangley party - also no disrespect to people that like them
      - its a nice party - I get it - they’re just not for me.<br /><br />Anyway,
      I finally had one I actually wanted to go to - my ethical dilemma arose
      after I had accepted the invitation when they began advertising that there
      would be a second open bar available throughout the night serving
      pharmaceuticals and uppers, and I’m a full on sober t-totaller - not even
      caffeine, barely even sugar - sort of person.<br /><br />
      Having quit drinking a long time ago I don’t mind being around people that
      are having fun but substance abuse (particularly at the level being
      encouraged here) just feels quite monstrous to me and makes people really
      hard to talk to. <br /><br />I weighed up going in early and just staying
      for the start of it but I would have felt so rude leaving an hour in
      because of sobriety - I didn’t want to seem judgemental or feel out of
      place because it’s supposed to be a big free celebration of love.
      <br /><br />I weighed it up ethically and socially, reneged on the
      invitation and didn’t go. <br /><br />I feel bad, but I think it was
      better for everyone. <br /><br />Was I right? I don’t know.<br /><br /><br />
      <b
        >Describe your culture and how the people around you have influenced
        your value and identity...</b
      >
      <br /><br />Like many people growing up in smalltown 90s New Zealand my
      hometown became the blue print for the lifestyle I never wanted to live, I
      used university as my excuse and got out fast.<br /><br />
      I came straight to Wellington and started at Vic and got (most) of an arts
      degree (Film and Psychology) and all of a film diploma (Yes, very funny)
      <br /><br />And did what anyone with a BA in people watching would do and
      started running bars in lieu of a real job. For 15 years. <br /><br />I
      did well in the industry because I was reliable, pragmatic, quick on my
      feet, good at fixing things, good at managing people, and socially
      connected to a point I could get most issues sorted before anybody else
      noticed there was a problem. I did well and had some great mentors.
      <br /><br />This industry taught me to value grit and humility above all.
      My values are firmly grounded in the realm of hardworking, down to earth,
      good people.<br /><br />
      I like problem solvers who have worked hard to get where they are, people
      that hunger to stay relevant and better themselves, and developed the key
      goal in life to remain hungry for development and betterment.
      <br /><br />I also learnt a special respect for creatives that have learnt
      to apply their rampant creativity to a structure, make it marketable and
      monetize it. <br /><br /><br /><br /><b
        >Identify your strengths that will support your learning journey?</b
      ><br /><br />
      I’m driven, stubborn and competitive - I don’t mind competing with other
      people but I generally just compete with myself. <br />Beat my last score
      - take better notes this time - make a road map to solve this so next time
      I can get straight through it etc. <br /><br />I love jedi mind tricks and
      bio hacks for learning - I fully believe we can expand our comprehension
      and neuroplasticity by training our minds - I think it’s genuinely
      advantageous and I love using myself as a test subject. <br /><br />I’m
      very curious and creative - I love harnessing my adhd and using it to my
      advantage. I can throw out a lot of solutions to a problem I understand
      properly and take criticism really well (because I know full well that 9
      out of those 10 solutions will be bad and thats all part of the
      process)<br />
      <br />I get equal satisfaction solving other peoples problems - I really
      like collaborating, even if its just being a sounding board. I think its a
      really special thing to help bump someone else onto the right path when
      they’re a bit stuck. <br /><br /><br /><br /><b
        >Evaluate how your limitations may effect your learning journey?</b
      ><br /><br />
      Burnnouts a bit of a risk - maybe the biggest. I feel like I’ve come into
      this with a lot less experience than a lot of the other participants have
      and I’m going to push myself pretty hard to stay relevant. <br /><br />I
      can push myself a little hard sometimes. <br /><br />I’m also potentially
      limited by the fact that I have very little experience working with code
      so it might take me a little longer to get used to than a lot of the other
      people on this course. And maybe a little imposter syndrome along with
      that but I’ll get over it. <br /><br />This can also make it a bit hard to
      ask questions on discord because, lets be real - there are LOADS of stupid
      questions. And nobody feels good about asking them. Luckily chat gpt
      doesn’t judge me so I’ll be going there first. <br /><br />My workspace
      poses some limitations - I’ve never had to put together a decent work from
      home space so I’ve got a deck chair, a chrome book and a TV to work with
      right now. I will work on this! <br /><br /><br /><br /><b
        >Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others but there was resistance or tension. <br />Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, your reflections on on any
        other strategies you would try now and why?
      </b>
      <br /><br />I was having some struggles at a job (office job, court clerk
      for the government, admin) because I was finding that the space was much
      too disruptive for me. <br /><br />I think the tension arrose because my
      way of dealing with discomfort is blocking it out and ignoring it. My desk
      placement was opposite a person with a compulsive singing issue - when
      they had their airpods in and were in flow they would compulsively (badly)
      sing (/moan, hum, singing is a stretch, there weren't many words) along
      with anything they listened to, despite an office full of people asking
      them not to. In the darker hours other workmates would start to give in
      and join in bad sing-alongs to try lift the mood and the singer was very
      liked, and hardworking, so no negative comments were made. I think it
      might have been a comulsion tick so I didn't bring it up either.
      <br /><br />I can’t concentrate on work while there’s singing, I really
      really started to dislike it but I needed to stay seated with my team
      because I was still in training and they were the people I needed to help
      me learn. I tried listening to music but that would zone me out too much,
      and I felt like I was missing out on the social aspect of the office
      because it cut me off from all conversation. <br /><br />I tried timing my
      day so I wouldn’t overlap shifts and breaks with them, which helped a
      little, but in the end I resorted to just loading my phone with podcasts
      and sitting listening to those all afternoon to block out the ruckus. And
      while it may have made me seem a bit isolated from the team I’m 100% sure
      it kept me saner and much more productive. <br /><br />In hindsight I
      probably should have just asked them nicely to shut up, and asked to be
      moved somewhere quieter. <br /><br />But its hard to do that in a big
      environment where this behaviour is an established norm - nobody wants to
      be the fun police, and they were just young and trying to make the most of
      a crappy office. <br /><br /><br />
