        Problem-solviing is a vital facet of the development process. It helps
        us evolve as creators and helps hown our lateral thinking and
        emotional-control.
      </p>
      <p class="pad">
        Todays designated blog post is about exploring the problem solving
        process, which is generally equal parts borrowing ideas off the
        internet, research, and throwing code against a wall like cooked
        spaghetti to see if it works yet. The scientific method.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        The first thing I do when I face a new code logic problem is break it
        down into pseudocode. Pseudocode is a set of coding instructions that
        you write for yourself that have nothing to do with the actual running
        code, and reads like a story or a road map to your solution, it allows
        you to break your logic problem into smaller increments, establishing
        the order of operations and giving some direction to the first rounds of
        research as you see the path to your solution solidifying ahead of you.
        It will also highlight the little knowledge gaps you will need to fill
        as your research journey begins - I like to store the method and
        functions I want to use in my pseudocode and keep developing it as I
        find more applicable solutions - nine times out of ten I don’t end up
        using my first brainstorm but it sets the path for me to follow when Im
        starting out. I also think that once you’ve laid a plan out in words
        that’s full of achievable increments that you logically understand,
        there’s a special little positivity switch in the brain that
        acknowledges that the problem is 100% solvable and you know how to get
        there. It really helps.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        Research takes many forms - I like to research the challenge and the
        path - I look for key words in the question, anything I’m not 100%
        certain of, and google them - nothings more frustrating than getting
        halfway in and realising you’re failing your tests because you made a
        logical choice to do things the normal way, but you read the challenge
        wrong and it’s actually the wrong way. I research every step of the
        process I want to follow, find the methods I want to call and pinpoint
        the main activity each function will need to do - will I be manipulating
        an array of strings? OK check all those methods, what sort of
        manipulation? Do I need to modify a part separately? How do I need to
        return the data? My pseudocode road map is great for this. This is also
        the stage where the first plan generally becomes redundant as soon as
        the research shows up a shortcut or method that will do the job of a
        massive chunk of the code I was about to write.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        Keeping an updated pseudocode will be very helpful in the long run - it
        makes for a great anchor point that you can check back with if you ever
        get lost during your code construction phase.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        Once I’m happy that I’ve found all the working information I want I
        start cobbling together code - I follow my structure, and test as I go
        to make sure the code is flowing like I want it to. I test functions,
        arrays and methods using console.log - this makes a little snapshot of
        the data you are manipulating and prints it to a console. Printing
        before and after it has been processed by the code structure lets you
        see clearly if your logic has worked correctly, and brings up convenient
        error messages telling you where the processing errors are if it is not
        compiling. These messages will help pinpoint little problems in your
        code, and can also be copied into google or your favourite AI code
        helper if you are getting seriously lost.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        This is the stage where things can get tricky - once you’ve cleaned up
        your syntax errors and can’t figure out your console.log errors it’s
        time to get a bit more serious with the fixing. This is when I start
        googling the whole question and try see if other peoples codes can help
        fix it. Quite often someones already figured out similar logic
        challenges online and there may just be one or two little tweaks to be
        made to get it working. If that doesn’t work I give the code to an AI to
        check - first I ask for syntax and little bugs to be checked, then I’ll
        start delving into the specifics of why it isn’t working. This can be
        very helpful but sometimes misleading. The key with using AI is being
        very careful with your prompts - keep it specific and do not trust the
        code it spits out unless you can tell what it’s up to.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        If AI can’t help me this is generally where I give up for a bit and go
        have a sandwich. A really good sandwich. Or go see the sunlight, I
        thoroughly recommend it. It will prepare you nicely for the next
        technique which is talking to an inanimate object - I recommended food
        and outdoors first because sanity is important, food and sun will help.
        If you go straight into talking to a rubber duck you may not feel so
        great about it.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        The rubber duck technique (side note - I strongly dislike this
        technique, it makes me feel so stupid, and for some reason it actually
        works really well) So this technique fell into the zeitgeist when some
        guy would frequently go and have a whine to his coworker when he was
        stuck, and the act of explaining his problems would generally help him
        get to the solution without needing any actual feedback. Co-worker got
        sick of listening to him and told him to talk to a rubber duck instead,
        which works just as well, and a popular problem solving movement was
        born! The idea behind this is that explaining your process from
        beginning to end will force you to rethink the position that you are
        stuck on - obviously it wont work for syntax errors, or solving anything
        drastically outside your knowledge pool, but it will help you take a new
        perspective on your work, especially if you have been fixated on one
        small area for quite a while. Break it down for the duck - explain your
        logic process in simple bite sized bits so its hollow brain has time to
        process. I don’t know why it works but it does, I just like it because
        it means my colleagues don’t have to listen to me whine.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        If your still stuck after the duck it’s time to get help - if you know
        anybody tackling the same problems you are, they’re a good place to
        start - sometimes all it takes is a few helpful words from someone
        sympathetic - every single person that you know that codes has been in
        the exact same place as you are, and even if they just make sympathetic
        noises and can’t help it will be less degrading than needlessly talking
        to a rubber duck. Keep trying.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        At this point it’s time to go to the experts - whoever they may be.
        Tutors, mentors, bosses, higher ups, mates with loads of experience, or
        (at the lower end of the scale) strangers on the internet. Pro-tip- if
        you’re asking the internet for help open two accounts on your site of
        choice and as soon as you post your question attack it viciously with
        your other account. In my completely non-scientific experience you’ll
        get way more attention and useful help if people they’re standing up to
        cyber bullies and it makes them less nervous about being the first post
        to answer back. Weird science. Anyway, formulate your questions well -
        don’t let the spiraling lost-programmer doom effect how you pose the
        question to your chosen expert - nothing is impossible, and if you act
        like it is, you’re just being dramatic. Be prepared to explain your
        process, show them your code, explain all the avenues you explored to
        get where you have and take every bit of advice you get - even if its
        something horrible like backtrack 3 days work and start with a
        completely different approach - experts are also coders, and have also
        been in this position. They know what it’s like to go through this and
        they know you’ll come out stronger. Just listen.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        If that doesn’t work maybe make another sandwich. Take the rest of the
        night off. Try again tomorrow. Unfortunately nothing is unsolvable so
        the key is just to keep going. Be the 10,000th monkey that writes the
        Shakespeare. Smash the buttons. Eat sandwiches and look at the sky and
        the best of luck to you.
      </p>
      <p class="pad">
        So we’re supposed to write about a time we were blocked by a simple
        problem - I have many of those times. I’m new to coding so I still
        habitually make a few regular mistakes so they’re generally the first
        thing I check when things don’t work - I always forget to call my
        functions before I console log the solution, and this is almost always
        the first thing my console logging picks up on. It feels dumb every
        single time it happens but it’s an easy fix at least. I think writing
        testing and where to console.log into the pseudocode is a pretty good
        shout.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        My most elegant problem solving happens in the planning and research
        phase - wide reading and lateral thinking can save so much complicated
        coding from the beginning, and all it takes is dedicating proper time
        and focus to the parameters of what you need to achieve. Seeing your
        logic broken down into manageable pieces and checking the methods
        associated with every moving part you have built into your process
        really opens your eyes up to different possible approaches. The more you
        chew on your plan, the easier it will be to digest. And execute.
        Elegantly. It also feels great to start your problem solving mission
        with that burst of positive energy you get from finding early solutions
        and building early confidence. Even just the act of refreshing your
        prior knowledge about what you are working on has a definite helpful
        boost.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        One of the more unfortunate aspsects of problem solving is, like any
        good deep habit change, its easy to talk about and put on paper but the
        reality is the techniques take time to master. It takes a long time to
        build the confidence to follow through with good problem solving, and it
        takes a fair amount of humility to reach out to somebody for help when
        your problem solving path stays rocky.
      </p>
      <p class="pad">
        If I was to reflect on how confident I felt asking my peers for help at
        this stage in my learning process I would say "not very" - but not for
        bad reasons! I don't know my peers - I have an idea of whos work makes
        them seem capable, limited sense of their personalities, and no idea how
        they work. I lack confidence when it comes to communicating my problems
        and often find it easier to slowly spell it out to AI than format a
        reasonable logical version of my own system errors and publish them
        online. I think once I start working with people and collaborating it
        will really help me learn to be better. I also haven't ever been that
        stuck on my work to need to ask - my biggest draw backs and sticking
        have point have been due to me misreading questions or trying to be too
        ambitious with my code. These aren't group-problems, these are
        me-problems.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        If I was to reflect on how confident I felt asking my coaches for help I
        would say realtively confident, but I wouldn't want to bother them with
        anything other than a propper code crisis yet because if it just ends up
        being a typo issue I would feel very very silly. I want to use the
        coaches advice later in the program when we start getting the propper
        crunchy code, and then I want to make more of en effort to get their
        guidance at the start of a problem, because I know the tips they will
        give me about structure, method and technique could really set me off on
        a great path if I can get that tip early on, before things are propperly
        pear shaped.
      </p>

        I already think the situations I have gotten myself in to in foundations
        have taught me plenty about problem solving and where I could refine my
        pactise. I have learnt that I need to practise getting myself out of
        trouble earlier, and getting back on track faster, and I have learnt
        that the awesome thing about getting advice off a human (vs an AI) is
        humans will take the time to help you fix yourself up within the
        spectrum of your knowldge. I am very confident that further practise and
        further relection will play a key role in refining my problem solving
        mission even further.
      </p>
      <p class="pad">
        If I was to reflect in a time I was reluctant to ask for help I would
        tell you about an incident right at the end of sprint 4 - I was pretty
        drained and just couldnt get my head around modules at all. I was in
        that empty functional working space where I was just pushing to get
        fininshed and long past the stage where anything was getting absorbed
        anymore. Its that mechanical state where you proofread a thing for 4
        hours, and don't recall a second of it a day later. I tried to get into
        it, I really did. I knew there was a Q&A coming up and I knew I could
        try for help there (or even better I knew some lucid peer may even be
        having the same struggles and may articulate them so I wouldn't have to)
        I tried following the instructions, crashed, found out my software was
        out of date, bumbled around with that for a bit. Realised there was no
        point in even trying to get healp while my gear was out of date spent
        half the Q&A battling Node and not asking for help because I felt like
        asking was just irelevant. I did actually end up asking for help - I got
        my 'puter functional immeadiately started getting some weird shell error
        when I was following the instruction set out in the curriculum exercise,
        and jumped in the Q&A to ask about it, and turns out I was entering my
        prompts in wrong, so that was helpful (and got the reassurance that it
        was a newly written piece of the program material so it was
        understandable that I could be struggling to follow it a little) And
        everything was fine. So why was I worried? Because not being able to
        sort out your tool kit is a pathetic reason for not being able to work
        on a project. But I need to get over that. It also felt like a problem
        that was outside of the appropriate spectrum to ask about - curriculum
        stuff? sure, not being able to work my developer suite propperly? not so
        much. I need to get over that too. Anything that slows my progress is a
        fair reason to look for help. And I know early intervention is key. Next
        time I would stop myself before I started modules and have a bubble
        bath. Maybe even leave it for Saturday. I would have read ahead in the
        curriculum and done everything else, watched the Q&A whenever I was
        with-it enough to start back on the modules work, and I would have
        chilled and watched a bunch of youtube about it before I even opened my
        work. Seeing it in action would have put me on a much better tragectory
        (yeah, in hindsite while I was fighting node and listening to the Q&A I
        did miss a fair bit of demo that I really needed to see)
