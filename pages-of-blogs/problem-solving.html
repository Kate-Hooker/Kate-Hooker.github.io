        I like to think that every problem we have to solve we’re being sent on
        a adventure into the ether, and when they don’t take us where we wanted
        to go we always end up finding what we needed to find . Even if it's the
        aid and sympathy of a cleverer friend, or the humility to go and tell
        your repo to fork itself and make it all tomorrows’ problem instead.
        That still counts as growth and evolution, definitely.

        Todays designated blog post is about exploring the problem solving
        process, which is generally equal parts borrowing ideas off the
        internet, research, and throwing my code against a wall like cooked
        spaghetti to see if it works yet. The scientific method.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        T The first thing I do when I face a new code logic problem is break it
        down into pseudocode. Pseudocode is a set of coding instructions that
        you write for yourself that have nothing to do with the actual running
        code, and reads like a story or a road map to your solution, it allows
        you to break your logic problem into smaller increments, establishing
        the order of operations and giving some direction to the first rounds of
        research as you see the path to your solution solidifying ahead of you.
        It will also highlight the little knowledge gaps you will need to fill
        as your research journey begins - I like to store the method and
        functions I want to use in my pseudocode and keep developing it as I
        find more applicable solutions - nine times out of ten I don’t end up
        using my first brainstorm but it sets the path for me to follow when Im
        starting out. I also think that once you’ve laid a plan out in words
        that’s full of achievable increments that you logically understand,
        there’s a special little positivity switch in the brain that
        acknowledges that the problem is 100% solvable and you know how to get
        there. It really helps.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        Research takes many forms - I like to research the challenge and the
        path - I look for key words in the question, anything I’m not 100%
        certain of, and google them - nothings more frustrating than getting
        halfway in and realising you’re failing your tests because you made a
        logical choice to do things the normal way, but you read the challenge
        wrong and it’s actually the wrong way. I research every step of the
        process I want to follow, find the methods I want to call and pinpoint
        the main activity each function will need to do - will I be manipulating
        an array of strings? OK check all those methods, what sort of
        manipulation? Do I need to modify a part separately? How do I need to
        return the data? My pseudocode road map is great for this. This is also
        the stage where the first plan generally becomes redundant as soon as
        the research shows up a shortcut or method that will do the job of a
        massive chunk of the code I was about to write.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        Keeping an updated pseudocode will be very helpful in the long run - it
        makes for a great anchor point that you can check back with if you ever
        get lost during your code construction phase.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        Once I’m happy that I’ve found all the working information I want I
        start cobbling together code - I follow my structure, and test as I go
        to make sure the code is flowing like I want it to. I test functions,
        arrays and methods using console.log - this makes a little snapshot of
        the data you are manipulating and prints it to a console. Printing
        before and after it has been processed by the code structure lets you
        see clearly if your logic has worked correctly, and brings up convenient
        error messages telling you where the processing errors are if it is not
        compiling. These messages will help pinpoint little problems in your
        code, and can also be copied into google or your favourite AI code
        helper if you are getting seriously lost.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        This is the stage where things can get tricky - once you’ve cleaned up
        your syntax errors and can’t figure out your console.log errors it’s
        time to get a bit more serious with the fixing. This is when I start
        googling the whole question and try see if other peoples codes can help
        fix it. Quite often someones already figured out similar logic
        challenges online and there may just be one or two little tweaks to be
        made to get it working. If that doesn’t work I give the code to an AI to
        check - first I ask for syntax and little bugs to be checked, then I’ll
        start delving into the specifics of why it isn’t working. This can be
        very helpful but sometimes misleading. The key with using AI is being
        very careful with your prompts - keep it specific and do not trust the
        code it spits out unless you can tell what it’s up to.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        If AI can’t help me this is generally where I give up for a bit and go
        have a sandwich. A really good sandwich. Or go see the sunlight, I
        thoroughly recommend it. It will prepare you nicely for the next
        technique which is talking to an inanimate object - I recommended food
        and outdoors first because sanity is important, food and sun will help.
        If you go straight into talking to a rubber duck you may not feel so
        great about it.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        The rubber duck technique (side note - I strongly dislike this
        technique, it makes me feel so stupid, and for some reason it actually
        works really well) So this technique fell into the zeitgeist when some
        guy would frequently go and have a whine to his coworker when he was
        stuck, and the act of explaining his problems would generally help him
        get to the solution without needing any actual feedback. Co-worker got
        sick of listening to him and told him to talk to a rubber duck instead,
        which works just as well, and a popular problem solving movement was
        born! The idea behind this is that explaining your process from
        beginning to end will force you to rethink the position that you are
        stuck on - obviously it wont work for syntax errors, or solving anything
        drastically outside your knowledge pool, but it will help you take a new
        perspective on your work, especially if you have been fixated on one
        small area for quite a while. Break it down for the duck - explain your
        logic process in simple bite sized bits so its hollow brain has time to
        process. I don’t know why it works but it does, I just like it because
        it means my colleagues don’t have to listen to me whine.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        If your still stuck after the duck it’s time to get help - if you know
        anybody tackling the same problems you are, they’re a good place to
        start - sometimes all it takes is a few helpful words from someone
        sympathetic - every single person that you know that codes has been in
        the exact same place as you are, and even if they just make sympathetic
        noises and can’t help it will be less degrading than needlessly talking
        to a rubber duck. Keep trying.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        At this point it’s time to go to the experts - whoever they may be.
        Tutors, mentors, bosses, higher ups, mates with loads of experience, or
        (at the lower end of the scale) strangers on the internet. Pro-tip- if
        you’re asking the internet for help open two accounts on your site of
        choice and as soon as you post your question attack it viciously with
        your other account. In my completely non-scientific experience you’ll
        get way more attention and useful help if people they’re standing up to
        cyber bullies and it makes them less nervous about being the first post
        to answer back. Weird science. Anyway, formulate your questions well -
        don’t let the spiraling lost-programmer doom effect how you pose the
        question to your chosen expert - nothing is impossible, and if you act
        like it is, you’re just being dramatic. Be prepared to explain your
        process, show them your code, explain all the avenues you explored to
        get where you have and take every bit of advice you get - even if its
        something horrible like backtrack 3 days work and start with a
        completely different approach - experts are also coders, and have also
        been in this position. They know what it’s like to go through this and
        they know you’ll come out stronger. Just listen.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        If that doesn’t work maybe make another sandwich. Take the rest of the
        night off. Try again tomorrow. Unfortunately nothing is unsolvable so
        the key is just to keep going. Be the 10,000th monkey that writes the
        Shakespeare. Smash the buttons. Eat sandwiches and look at the sky and
        the best of luck to you.
      </p>
      <p class="pad">
        So we’re supposed to write about a time we were blocked by a simple
        problem - I have many of those times. I’m new to coding so I still
        habitually make a few regular mistakes so they’re generally the first
        thing I check when things don’t work - I always forget to call my
        functions before I console log the solution, and this is almost always
        the first thing my console logging picks up on. It feels dumb every
        single time it happens but it’s an easy fix at least. I think writing
        testing and where to console.log into the pseudocode is a pretty good
        shout.
      </p>

      <p class="pad">
        My most elegant problem solving happens in the planning and research
        phase - wide reading and lateral thinking can save so much complicated
        coding from the beginning, and all it takes is dedicating proper time
        and focus to the parameters of what you need to achieve. Seeing your
        logic broken down into manageable pieces and checking the methods
        associated with every moving part you have built into your process
        really opens your eyes up to different possible approaches. The more you
        chew on your plan, the easier it will be to digest. And execute.
        Elegantly. It also feels great to start your problem solving mission
        with that burst of positive energy you get from finding early solutions
        and building early confidence. Even just the act of refreshing your
        prior knowledge about what you are working on has a definite helpful
        boost.
